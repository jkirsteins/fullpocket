*DISCLAIMER: This post contains mention of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are known to induce anxiety, and may cause severe loss of financial security.*

Cryptocurrency is hot, right? 🌶

Well, it was hot. Then it wasn't. Then it was again. Now, I don't even know anymore.

I don't know how hot it is, or how justified its hotness. However, there sure are a lot of stories with the words "cryptocurrency" and "scam" appearing together in the title.

This week's article is called [Cryptoqueen: How this woman scammed the world, then vanished](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-50435014).

It is about a Bulgarian entrepreneur who co-founded an impressive cryptocurrency operation:

> Between August 2014 and March 2017 **more than €4bn** was invested in dozens of countries. From Pakistan to Brazil, from Hong Kong to Norway, from Canada to Yemen… even Palestine.

The article is pretty wild, and I encourage you to [read it](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-50435014), even if you usually have no interest in cryptocurrencies.

The outline of the article is:

- raise money
- background
- disappearance
- speculation

Additionally, I would like to highlight two points:

- similar scams (*woops, spoiler alert*) can have an outsized impact on everyday people;
- they didn't have a product!

## Spoiler Alert

Before going further, I'm going to cut to the chase here a bit. OneCoin is a ponzi scheme.

Here is [a press release by the Central Bank of Samoa](https://www.cbs.gov.ws/index.php/dmsdocument/7184) mentioning this: 

> OneCoin is labelled as a “Hybrid Ponzi-Pyramid Scheme” because the scam contains ingredients of both types of scams – Ponzi Scheme and Pyramid Scheme.

This is pretty common. It would seem that cryptocurrencies end up as one of the following:

- not a cryptocurrency (e.g. some database in the basement of an otherwise conservative financial institution); or
- a scam; or
- a vehicle to enable second order scams.

To the last point, here is an aptly named website: [Days Since A Cryptocurrency Exchange Has Lost More Than $100 Million](http://dayssinceacryptocurrencyexchangehaslostmorethan100million.com)

# Impact on Everyday People

One thing you notice if you follow cryptocurrency news, is the impact on people who don't follow cryptocurrency news. 

OneCoin is no different. It not only got people to buy in with their savings, but also those people then got their friends and family to buy in as well:

> "Before long, she had invested €10,000 of her own money - and persuaded friends and family to invest €250,000 of theirs."

Sometimes the amounts are significant:

> To buy the packages some sold their cattle, their land and even their houses - with disastrous consequences.

And so can be the consequences:

> Some are running because they got loans from a bank. Some are hiding. Some are divorced.

Ouch!

Additionally, this part sounds like a scene from a movie:

> One of the main OneCoin offices in Kampala is attached to a church. There are videos of the minister, known as Bishop Fred, leading the congregation in call and response. "One Life!" he shouts. "One Coin!" the congregations replies.

# Impressive Lack of Technology

*NB: this point not really related to personal finance. It's more related to my general surprise at the success of a cryptocurrency that isn't one in the first place*

Raising 4bn+ is no small feat. Especially considering they gathered those investments without having a product.

> It was a cryptocurrency company, and it had been running for a while - but it didn't have a blockchain.

For the record, a blockchain is what enables all the claims about cryptocurrency ("decentralized", "independent", "revolutionary"). A cryptocurrency without a blockchain is little better than, let's say... a cheque.

While one might reasonably assume this would make the cryptocurrency less desirable, [one would be wrong](https://www.coindesk.com/onecoin-claims-its-not-a-ponzi-or-pyramid-scheme):

> as a “**centralized**, closed source cryptocurrency” with “strict” anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules, OneCoin “is much more compliant than decentralized [cryptocurrencies].”

Lacking a blockchain just makes it *centralized* (and thus more compliant) 🤷‍♂️ 

Also, I find it amusing that this quote comes from a press release where they try to convince people they are not a ponzi scheme**.
