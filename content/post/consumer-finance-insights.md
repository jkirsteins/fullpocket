Here's a simplified model for life:
- you go do your thing at work;
- you get some money; 
- you use that money to do your thing outside of work. Your non-work thing, if you will.

Generally, people want to do little of the work thing, a lot of the non-work thing, and that's it. 

In practice, there's also a third thing, where you make spending decisions that you don't necessarily enjoy. They take some money away from the things you do enjoy, so to make up for it - you have to do more of the work thing (but then you have less time to do the non-work thing üôÄ). So the actual model is more like:
- work - do your thing;
- you get some money;
- you waste some money (say, 10%);
- you use 90% of your money to do your non-work thing.

It's the second law of thermodynamics, as applied to financial management.

> Every money transfer (between your work and non-work things) involves some loss of money in an unusable form

# What to do About It?

At a very abstract level you have two options:

1. do more of the work thing; OR
2. lose less money to the in-between thing.

You could try being more deliberate about your finances, for example:

- track spending to see how your small everyday purchases add up;
- budget to prevent e.g. one hobby from ballooning, and draining resources from another hobby;
- do your taxes on time to avoid late fees;
- keep your invoices, so you can benefit from insurance and warranty; 
- etc.

# Does it Work?

Turns out, for a lot of people, none of these work very well. 

People will start budgeting, but give up cause all of these are a hassle, and the alternative is instant gratification on a sweet impulse purchase.

I mean, it makes sense. People didn't evolve to ignore (previously scarce) gratification opportunities ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

# So Get to the Point...

The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau produced [a report](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201702_cfpb_Consumer-Insights-on-Managing-Spending.pdf) in 2017 about how consumers manage their finances.

It outlines some commonly reported challenges to improved financial management and mentions some approaches that - in a lab setting - noticeably improve financial decisionmaking.

# Report Summary

These are the main challenges as reported by the participants. Do any sound familiar?

- it's a hassle (have to do math, paperwork, taxes, track invoices, review your transactions, etc.)
- people track rare expensive purchases, but ignore smaller or impulse purchases (but these add up);
- special occasions are off-budget (friend getting married? Splurge. Birthday? Splurge. Apple releases a new... well, you get the idea). The issue is not spending per se, but not being aware/intentional about it;
- discounts. Simple yet efficient. You go to the store to buy a carton of milk, but you come back with 3. There was a limited time discount, so you figure it's going to save some money. Per-unit cost is better, but in absolute terms - you just spent 2x as much as you intended to. Bonus points if you don't drink milk too much, and the extra cartons spoil.
- not sticking to shopping lists;
- not being good at remembering the important long-term goals;
- not being aware of how much money is still available. This is especially true if you use multiple banks and have your money spread out across multiple accounts. Bonus points if you check your balance once a month (due to missing mobile app, or horrible online experience);
- cash vs credit cards.

This happens *despite* everybody being aware of these issues. People generally know what they do wrong, or what they should do differently. They don't generally heed their own advice, though.

People also really hate hassle. Most people will use a shitty high-interest rate credit card, instead of going through the hassle of switching. 

Often, people get overwhelmed. They start a budget, start tracking transactions... and at some point, it just feels so *much* that they zone out, and stop checking/updating it.

## Traps of Scarcity

Unsurprisingly, people recovering from scarcity have it extra tough. It takes extra willpower, and extra scarcity; but human nature is, instead, to go into "immediate" mode.

## Lack of Time

- Another prominent reason for not following a budget was lack of time.

# Potential solutions

The report explored giving people immediate feedback about how much money is available. They produced special payment cards that have a display on them, showing the amount available for spending. This amount syncs with a special budget app.

In a lab setting, this had a meaningful impact on people's spending decisions. 

The effect did not come down just to this information being available, however. People who had the same information - but didn't see it visually - did not have as pronounced a change in their decisionmaking.

# Takeaways

Skim the report, it's pretty interesting. For me, the main takeaways were:

- Humans are visual beings! If you have a budget, visualize it. If you have a savings goal, associate it with images;
- Quick and accurate feedback is super important. The quicker you get feedback, the better (I guess this is the case with everything in life).
