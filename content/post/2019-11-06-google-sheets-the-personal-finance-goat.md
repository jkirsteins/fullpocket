A great deep-dive by [Alex Cohen](https://twitter.com/anothercohen) into
how Google Sheets can be the ultimate tool for tracking your expenses.

With a little effort, Google Sheets can:

- easily sync transactions with your banks;
- send you SMS notifications and reminders;
- sync with Zillow to track the market value of your assets; and
- it can do charts pretty well.

Combine all of this, and you get a great tool for tracking your net worth.
