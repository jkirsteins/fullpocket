This week's article is from The New York Times about the budgets of 4 middle-class families.

There's no single takeaway in it. It does not contain advice on how to manage finances. It does not offer value judgments on different expense categories. Quoting from the article, the stated goal is:

> Their stories help illustrate how a middle-class existence has fundamentally shifted over a generation.

The article is really well done. However, if you need some gentle nudging, here are some points that I found interesting:

- Work hard and be lucky;
- U.S. student loans; and
- Something always comes up.

## Work Hard and Be Lucky

One of the better-off families, unsurprisingly, are deliberate about their financial management:

> They made deliberate financial decisions that have worked out well.

So far, so good. Work hard and reap the rewards. It's a parable. The article, however, also emphasizes the other side of the coin.

It wasn't *just* the hard work. It was also a bit of being at the right place, at the right time, surrounded by the right people:

- they were ready to buy a home in 2008, and benefitted from depressed prices;
- their employers provided "spectacular" retirement and health benefits; and
- their parents contributed to their tuition payments.

## U.S. Student Loans

This part might be a bit boring to U.S. readers who - presumably - know this already. But others might be surprised at the amounts going towards repaying student loans. One of the family reports owing $70,000 for *unfinished education*.

It is already a lot of money to spend on education. But *unfinished education*? Ouch!

Interestingly, while you do hear a lot about the 5-to-6 digit student loans:

- on average, it is around $20,000 (still a lot!); and
- [people who are most likely to default, owe closer to $5,000](https://www.arnoldventures.org/stories/saddled-with-debt-and-an-unfinished-degree/).

I did some Googling, and turns out - you can not easily default on study debt. [Only 0.04% of people that file for bankruptcy, can succeed in getting their student loans discharged](https://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/student-loans-in-bankruptcy/).

For reference for the U.S. readers, here's what [higher education costs around the world](https://www.insider.com/cost-of-college-countries-around-the-world-2018-6).

# Something Always Comes Up

One family is retaining -4% of their monthly income. They commented, "something always comes up." Their income never seems to go as far as it needs to.

I said something similar to my wife on September 20th. ["Hey honey, something came up."](https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/07/apple-to-launch-iphone-11-on-sept-20-celebrate-with-reopening-of-fifth-avenue-store-in-nyc)

I'm kidding, though. It is a very relatable position. Anticipating "things that come up" is hard. [Being methodological about financial management is an unsolved problem](https://archive.thatfullpocket.com/post/u.s.-consumer-financial-habits/). We don't really have great tools to help people form better financial habits. 

# Wrap-up

Apart from these points, the article does a great job exploring middle-class family expenses. As well as putting it in historical context.
