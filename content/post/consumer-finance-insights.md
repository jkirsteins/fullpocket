The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau produced a report in 2017 about how consumers manage their finances. It's pretty interesting...

Being in control is important for financial well-being

We found that consumers aspire to manage their spending but for many reasons, many consumers spend more than intended and sometimes have difficulty in staying within their budgets.

In addition [...] these tools can be hard to use in guiding spending decisions in the moment.

> even those consumers [...] do not benchmark [...] frequently or regularly.

some reasons are unpredictability of income, and scarcity of resources. Other reasons are lack of financial education (we can address the latter at least partially with tools)

## Interesting

- 1/3rd live paycheck to paycheck
- 1/2 prefer not to think about money
- There are many types of financial and household documents that financial advisors recommend keeping in an “active file.” 5 However, our research indicated that many consumers have difficulty even finding a product warranty, bill receipt, credit card term sheet, or tax returns.
	- so keep an active file with these!
- important to be strategic. Even a simple consistent approach is good (e.g. 	deal with this weekly/monthly at the same time). Get into the habit
- 

## Challenges

1. it's a hassle (math, paperwork, taxes, invoice tracking, transactions, bla bla bla)
	- product insight: minimize hassle

2. circumstances affect our habits
	- people think about expensive purchases, but no tracking of minor/impulse purchases. 
	- Many not aware how this adds up
	- Meghan Casserly, Little Splurges that Cost Thousands in the End. Forbes, July 24, 2011.
	- many underestimate impact of infrequent purchases
		- Abigail B. Sussman & Adam L. Alter, The Exception Is the Rule: Underestimating and Overspending on Exceptional
Expenses, Journal of Consumer Research (December 2012).
	- many have "off-budget" expenses. Consider e.g. a meal out or a marriage gift a special occasion, so you don't plan/account for it, don't approach it strategically
		- don't do this
		- Ibid
	- discounts are a pain in the ass
		- let your guard down
		- buy more than you need/would have otherwise
		- See Karen Stilley, Planning to Make Unplanned Purchases? the Role of Discretionary Budgets in In-Store Decision Making, Advances in Consumer Research Volume 35, 2008; and On Amir & Erica Dawson, Motivating Discounts: Price Motivated Reasoning, Working paper, University of California-San Diego, 2007.
		- according to one survey, nearly all shoppers report buying items that are not on their shopping lists
			- never do this!
	- sometimes it is just hard to resist instant gratification
		- helps to keep in mind the long term benefits, but how to do that? not obvious

3. Hard to know how much money is left

	- important to have feedback as to how much money you have/can spend/have spent
	- Research shows that many consumers spend more with a credit card than they would with cash.
	- if you spend with a card, it's not obvious. Sometimes you only find out at the end of the month
	- this can cause anxiety about finances
		- need feedback about your situation! E.g. spend, and get a text about how much you have across all accounts

		
4. Consumers don't always implement financial decisions

	- More people know what they should do, than actually do it (e.g. do you know how much you should have in savings? Do you have that much in savings?)_
	- Most people know that switching to a credit card with a lower interest rate is a good idea, but only about one-third of consumers report doing so
		- a quarter think it's fine, as long as they can afford it (again, this adds up)
	- many want to do things, and know what they want to do, but postpone it because it's an overwhelming task (or seems like it)
		- The evidence suggests that consumers generally value financial management and planning and
believe they would benefit from it. But, like building an emergency savings account, switching
credit cards, or paying bills on time, it can seem like a large or overwhelming task

5. Traps of scarcity

	- recovering from scarcity requires extra levels of frugality, self control and planning. Extra tough!
	- people go into "immediate" mode

	
Additional comments

- Another prominent reason for not following a budget was lack of time. Approximately 23% of respondents either never got around to making a budget despite the intention to do so, or simply did not feel they had the time to craft one. In addition, nearly one in five respondents explicitly stated it was too much of a hassle to make a budget.
- those that have a budget: only 12% comparing their spending to their budget daily, 13% comparing weekly, and more than half comparing their spending to their budget once a month, if at all.

Personal insights:
- this is an infrastructure issue! Infrastructure is roads, and infrastructure is AWS, but shit like budgeting is an infrastructure issue as well!
- no infra in place for budgeting/syncing that data, so e.g. Apple card can display you. If there were some standard, Apple Pay could e.g. display your budget requiremennts as you spend (proven to influence behaviour)
- account aggregation is important
	
## Potential solutions 

- Providing feedback on spending reduces spending
	- backed by: Amit Poddar, Cameron M. Ellis & Timucin Ozcan, Imperfect Recall: The Impact of Composite Spending Information Disclosure on Credit Card Spending, Journal of Consumer Policy 38(1), December 2014.
- tested feedback card (very cool)
- tested budget app that syncs with the card
- tests in lab setting only!

### Test results

Only about 2% of respondents said they had a tool that could instantly communicate how much money they had left to use based on actual transactions

- reduced impulse spending, and more stay within budget (visual indicator is important! Because some were given textual information about this, but still spent more than those with the feedback card)
- more efficient use of time (addresses lack of time)
- the more convenient something is, the more will do it (duh!)
- more accessible, means people can start younger
- gave users peace of mind, less uncertainty! budgeting is overwhelming, but once you do it, you feel good. 

## Conclusion

Humans are visual beings! Also same with setting goals and associating with images.

Real-time feedback on spending is super important. The quicker you get feedback, the better. I guess this is the case with everything in life.
