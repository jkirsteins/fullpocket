There's an article on The New York Times about 4 different families and their budgets.

It's interesting to see this for the expense breakdowns, but also to see how each of the families view their own situation.

## Hard Work (and Luck)

One of the better-off families, unsurprisingly, are deliberate about their financial management:

> They made deliberate financial decisions that have worked out well

Yet they also recognize that good luck and timing play a meaningful role:

> They were ready to buy a home in 2008, as prices were trending lower. They also have the good fortune of having [...] “spectacular” retirement and health benefits [...] their parents contributed to their tuition payments.

I guess, one takeaway here is - be deliberate. Or more specifically: *be deliberate in the right places, at the right times, and while surrounded by the right people.* 📈

## The U.S. vs Other Countries

People face obstacles everywhere, but interestingly, in the U.S., there may be more burdens than elsewhere:

> What sets middle-class Americans apart, the study found, is that they are struggling under several burdens — low-income growth, rising costs, declining job security — **while those in many other countries face just one or two**.


## U.S. Student Loans

Two bits stood out to me as U.S.-specific. The first - having to account for large amounts of student debt in your monthly budget.

> [they] both have more than $70,000 in loan debt for college educations they never completed

That the educations were not even finished, is the icing on the cake:

- sometimes you change your mind, or your circumstances change. Shit happens 🤷‍♂️;
- if you change your mind midway through a thing, you should still honor your obligations for the thing; and
- it should be *very hard* to make a $70,000 mistake.

Interestingly, while you do hear a lot about the 5-to-6 digit student loans:

- on average, it is closer to $20,000 (still a lot!); and
- [people who are most likely to default, have closer to $5,000 in debt](https://www.arnoldventures.org/stories/saddled-with-debt-and-an-unfinished-degree/).

## Something Comes Up

Finally - here are some very relatable quotes from a middle-class family that describes themselves as being in survival mode (retaining roughly -4% of their monthly income):

> And yet their income **never seems to go as far as they need it to**.

> [...] every single month it seems like, "**Oh, something came up**"

I said something similar to my wife on September 20th. ["Hey honey, something came up."](https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/07/apple-to-launch-iphone-11-on-sept-20-celebrate-with-reopening-of-fifth-avenue-store-in-nyc)
