This week's article is called [Cryptoqueen: How this woman scammed the world, then vanished](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-50435014).

It is about a Bulgarian entrepreneur who co-founded an impressive cryptocurrency operation that turned out to be a scam:

> Between August 2014 and March 2017 **more than ‚Ç¨4bn** was invested in dozens of countries. From Pakistan to Brazil, from Hong Kong to Norway, from Canada to Yemen‚Ä¶ even Palestine.

The article is pretty wild, and I encourage you to [read it](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-50435014), even if you usually have no interest in cryptocurrencies.

# What's the Link to Personal Finance?

This is relevant to personal finance, in that it's a good reminder to:

- not treat cryptocurrencies as an investment;
- don't ask your friends, family, and neighbors to buy cryptocurrencies with you;
- especially, don't ask your friends, family, and neighbors to BORROW money, so that they could buy cryptocurrencies with you.

Just take a look at these quotes from the article, to see why.

Some people convinced their friends and family to buy in as well:

> "Before long, she had invested ‚Ç¨10,000 of her own money - and persuaded friends and family to invest ‚Ç¨250,000 of theirs."

Sometimes the amounts are significant to the victim:

> To buy the packages some sold their cattle, their land, and even their houses - with disastrous consequences.

The consequences can be significant too:

> Some are running because they got loans from a bank. Some are hiding. Some are divorced.

Ouch!

And then there's this part, which sounds like a scene from a movie:

> One of the main OneCoin offices in Kampala is attached to a church. There are videos of the minister, known as Bishop Fred, leading the congregation in call and response. "One Life!" he shouts. "One Coin!" the congregation's replies.

# But Was It REAAAALLLYYY a Scam?

Raising $4bn+ is no small feat. Could it have been a scam? Could something come of it one day?

It's probably a scam, yes, when people have collectively spent $4 billion on a product that *doesn't exist*:

> It was a cryptocurrency company, and it had been running for a while - but it didn't have a blockchain.

For the record, a blockchain is what enables all the claims about cryptocurrency ("decentralized", "independent", "revolutionary"). A cryptocurrency without a blockchain is little better than, let's say... a cheque.

While one might reasonably assume this would make the cryptocurrency less desirable, [one would be wrong](https://www.coindesk.com/onecoin-claims-its-not-a-ponzi-or-pyramid-scheme):

> as a ‚Äú**centralized**, closed source cryptocurrency‚Äù with ‚Äústrict‚Äù anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules, OneCoin ‚Äúis much more compliant than decentralized [cryptocurrencies].‚Äù

Lacking a blockchain just makes it *centralized* (and thus more compliant) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*(brb starting a new centralized cryptocurrency using Google Sheets)*

If you enjoy the *cryptocurrency scam* genre, here is another good one: [The Strange Tale of Quadriga](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/the-strange-tale-of-quadriga-gerald-cotten).

Related to cryptocurrency scams in general - there is this aptly named website: [Days Since A Cryptocurrency Exchange Has Lost More Than $100 Million](http://dayssinceacryptocurrencyexchangehaslostmorethan100million.com).

Finally, [here is a statement](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.onelife.eu/en/news/corporate-announcement) by OneCoin, denying that it has been used to launder money. It is a good read, if you enjoy self-victimization.
